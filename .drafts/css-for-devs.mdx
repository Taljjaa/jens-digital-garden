- Different types of lessons is great for all types of learners 
- need to pass quizzes sometimes to mark something as complete 
- get to use the stuff you just learned to build stuff 
- like that the course teaches you all the jargon you need, important for communicating and understanding people 
- dang those box model multiple choice questions were tricky but a lot of fun! 
- box-sizing: border-box, which flips the algorithm! In this case, the width numbers will include padding and border. So we don't have to factor them in. margin has no effect, no matter the box-sizing.
