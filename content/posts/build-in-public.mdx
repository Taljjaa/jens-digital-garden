One of my favorite online communities, [Virtual Coffee](https://virtualcoffee.io/), is having a monthly June challenge of building in public. I've always wanted to do this and while I got off to a good start I began struggling with my side project and fail to set boundaries when trying to carve out time for myself. It's totally okay to fail and now I know something that can help me be more successfull in the future. I enjoyed the small progress I was making before so now I'm going to try and challenge myself to do 30 days in a row of building in public and working on my Bullet Journal side project. 

Small incremental progress and having Twitter and my friends as an accountabilibuddy helps me stay on track. During these 30 days I hope to track my progress, talk about my failures, and celebrate my wins. Each morning I'll post about what I did the previous day, what I hope to do today, and any potential blockers. 

Starting side projects has always been a bit tough for me. They become so overwhelming and I have trouble planning out everything I need to do and breaking stuff down into small pieces. I tend to overplan and worry about the details which stops me from starting. I'm hoping since I only plan on working for about 45 minutes each day that I'll by only having a small goal for that time. 

I decided to build a bullet journal / to-do list because I think it's something that I will actually use, it's small so I won't get too overwhelmed, but it also has the potential for stretch goals. I like to use my side projects to learn new technologies or become more proficient at the ones I already use. 

## Bullet Journal - User Stories
One of the things I always try to do when I'm building something new is write down user stories. They help me road map exactly what I need to do feature wise and help me think about setting up things like models when it comes to my backend. 
- Members can sign up and login (Authentication and Authorization has always been something I struggled with so I'd like to build this from scratch and get a better feeling about how exactly this is achieved)
- Members can create to do lists for each day
- Members can write notes for each day 
- Members can rate their mood for each day

To keep the app small and focused these are the features I'm focusing on for the MVP. One other thing I want to spend a lot of time on for the MVP is writing tests and styling. CSS and I are often mortal enemies but I want to get better at using CSS and I've never really had a side project with a polished finished looking design. I plan on spending a lot of time thinking about the design and UX and making it something I can be proud of. Testing has always been something I want to get better at and at work I finally got the chance to learn testing and write my own tests. I want to continue growing my skills but this time with React Testing Library instead of Jest and Enzyme. 

### Stretch Goals 
One of the reasons I picked this idea is that I think once I get the "basic" features implemented there's a lot of fun different directions I can take the app. 

- Daily Streak tracker (For me, a streak tracker really help motivate me to continue to keep up my good habits and it's something I'm not sure how to implement but want to try!)
- Achievements (I think since I have the streak tracker I could set up fun achievements for logins, crossing off to-dos, rating moods, writing notes, etc.)

## Technologies 
If you're curious about the technologies I'll be using I plan on loosely following this [Fullstack React GraphQL TypeScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ypD7qv3Z8&t=4557s) tutorial by Ben Awad. Backend development and choosing the best technology for the job is still something I really struggle with, so I plan on using this. I already knew I wanted to use some of these technologies so I think this will be helpful but not stick me in tutorial hell.
