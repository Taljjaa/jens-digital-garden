I've now had my first developer job for a little over 2 months now and I've already learned so much. It's still a struggle but I feel like my head is finally above water. Before I started my job I didn't realize just how difficult the first week would be for me. This post is in now way meant to scare you, I just want to talk about my experience and maybe help some people along the way.

Advice I would give to my past self (I hope to expand all these and add more tips along the way)

- Find someone you feel comfortable with
- Ask more questions
- Set up 1-on-1s with you team to get to know them better
  - This will help the with the first two bullet points
- Don't spend more than 30 minutes on a problem without asking for help
- Take notes
