I've now had my first developer job for a little over 3 months now and I've already learned so much. It's still a struggle but I feel like my head is finally above water. Before I started my job I didn't realize just how difficult the first week would be for me. This post is in now way meant to scare you, I just want to talk about my experience and maybe help some people along the way. A lot of resources in our community will help you find your first job but I don't see as many that help you excel in it. This is not meant to be as a guaratee, but my hope is that by sharing my experience and what I wish I would have known that it can help you. This is meant to be advice to my past self. 

## Find someone you feel comfortable with
A new job and especially your first developer job can be very stressful. Even now I still struggle with it when I'm given a particularly hard task and feel just as lost as I did on the first day. I started to have less and less of these days but something that's helped me tremedously is finding someone I feel comfortable talking to. In the beginning it was my manager, then it became a senior engineer on the team, and now I have a lot more people who I feel comfortable reaching out too. A common piece of advice is to ask more questions, and while I whole-heartedly agree with it the aspect I struggled with the most was finding someone to ask. As a new developer I felt really nervous about bothering people, asking silly questions, and having people think I wasn't trying. A lot of this stemmed wanting to make a good impression and not seem like a burden to my new teammates. Luckily I was able come across some nice people who reassured me. 

## Ask more questions
This advice goes hand and hand with the first and it's probably some of the most common advice you'll hear. That should show you just how important it is. No one expects you to know everything and traverse through a new codebase easily (I hope). It takes time to ramp up and get into the swing of things. One thing I didn't know was that even senior and long time engineers need ramp up time! The best way to ramp up quickly and feel more comfortable and confident is to ask questions. Hopefully a lot of your questions will be answered in a onboarding document, like environment instructions, PR practices, and app structure.
