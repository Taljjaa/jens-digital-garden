I've always struggled with design so I've made it my goal for November to learn more and level up my design skills. I'll be going through the book [Refactoring UI](https://refactoringui.com/). It's been recommended by a number of different people and only a small bit into the book and I already agree with them. There's also videos on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/c/SteveSchoger/videos), that I hope to look into.
