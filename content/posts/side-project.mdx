How do you plan your side projects? Start coding immediately, plan out user stories, tech stack, wireframing? I'm definitely an overplanner and like to have a game plan before I start coding anything. It's really easy for me to get overwhelmed or distracted by everything that needs to be done, so I like to make a detailed plan for my side projects. I normally use side projects as a way to learn new things. Building an actual product that people will use isn't my first priority although I always hope that will happen. I plan to use this space to document my progress.

## Idea Planning 
Because I want to keep my side projects small, I needed an idea with an easy to execute MVP plan but with the potential to add more features in the future. During Flatiron one of the projects I wanted to do was a mobile app to track your mood, but I didn't have enough time to figure out React Native. Going off that idea I think an online bullet journal will be the perfect project to play around with and learn new things. 

## User Stories
- Users can sign up and login 
- Users can create to do lists for each day
- Users can write notes for each day 
- Users can rate mood for each day 
- Daily streak tracker

## Technologies 
Similar to how I create the user stories I pick technologies that I like, that will challenge me, and that might help me in the future. For this projects I'll create the frontend using React with TypeScript and Apollo, to get more practice using these technologies. I plan on using this project to get better at testing too, so I'll add React Testing Library. As a primarily frontend engineer I normally keep the backend similar across projects to focus more of my learning on the frontend. I'm still a little new to using GraphQL but I enjoy using it so my backend will use Apollo Server with Node.js. **Include database tech**

## Wireframes/Mockups

<img src="/BulletJournalHomePage.png" alt="Home Page of my bullet journal app which includes a navbar with home, sign up and login buttons. As well as a Calendar that will bring you to the details page of the associate day" />
<img src="/BulletJournalDayDetailsPage.png" alt="Day details page of my bullet journal app which includes the date, a to-dos list, mood scaler, and notes sections. As well as a button to save your changes" />

Since I'm not much of a design or have a lot of experience in UX I try to keep my wireframes simple and include just the basic building block of my app. I don't want to get overwhelmed with all the things I need to build so my mock ups tend to be a bit bare and aren't set in stone.
