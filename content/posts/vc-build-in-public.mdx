During the pandemic it's been hard to find a support system especially after graduating from Flatiron where I was very close with my cohort. Luckily I was able to find [Virtual Coffee](https://virtualcoffee.io/), and even though I'm not as active as I want to be just looking at other people's posts have been motivating for me. Each month we have a new theme to focus on and for June it's Building in Public. I first learned about building in public/learn in public from Swyx, here's a good intro [post](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/) about it!
