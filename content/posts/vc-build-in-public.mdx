During the pandemic it's been hard to find a support system especially after graduating from Flatiron where I was very close with my cohort. Luckily I was able to find [Virtual Coffee](https://virtualcoffee.io/), and even though I'm not as active as I want to be just looking at other people's posts have been motivating for me. Each month we have a new theme to focus on and for June it's Building in Public. I first learned about building in public/learn in public from Swyx, here's a good intro [post](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/) about it! I'm excited to try and build the habit of learning in public and making small incremental progress everyday. When I did #100DaysOfCode the first time I had a lot of success because instead of spending 3 hours at a time working and then feeling drained the following day I could just work for about an hour everyday and make a lot more progress. The toughest part for me is definitely only working 1 hour everyday. Sometimes I get so excited and gung ho about starting something new that I forget this process is more like a marathon than a sprint. 

For this month one of the things I want to build in public is my bullet journal side project. I'm going to try and use this space as a way to document my progress each day and encourage me make consistent progress. 

## Day 1 - 06/02
- I didn't know that the month of June was going to be building in public so I wasn't quite prepared!
- **What did you do yesterday?** 
    - Yesterday I submitted a PR to clean up [act warnings](https://reactjs.org/docs/test-utils.html#act) in our tests
- **What are you doing today?** 
    - Continuing my quest to clean up test warning! I'm also currently reading Emma Bostian's [De-Coding the Technical Interview Process](https://technicalinterviews.dev/) so I want to spend 30 minutes reading
- **Do you have any blockers**
    - Time is definitely the biggest factor stopping me from doing a lot of tech stuff on the side. By the end of the day I really want to step away from the screen especially now that I'm fully vaccinated! To solve this I'm hoping to wake up at a consistent time and start side project stuff before getting to work.
