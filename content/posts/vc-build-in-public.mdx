During the pandemic it's been hard to find a support system especially after graduating from Flatiron where I was very close with my cohort. Luckily I was able to find [Virtual Coffee](https://virtualcoffee.io/), and even though I'm not as active as I want to be just looking at other people's posts have been motivating for me. Each month we have a new theme to focus on and for June it's Building in Public. I first learned about building in public/learn in public from Swyx, here's a good intro [post](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/) about it! I'm excited to try and build the habit of learning in public and making small incremental progress everyday. When I did #100DaysOfCode the first time I had a lot of success because instead of spending 3 hours at a time working and then feeling drained the following day I could just work for about an hour everyday and make a lot more progress. The toughest part for me is definitely only working 1 hour everyday. Sometimes I get so excited and gung ho about starting something new that I forget this process is more like a marathon than a sprint. 

For this month one of the things I want to build in public is my bullet journal side project. I'm going to try and use this space as a way to document my progress each day and encourage me make consistent progress. 

## Day 1 - 06/02
- I didn't know that the month of June was going to be building in public so I wasn't quite prepared!
- **What did you do yesterday?** 
    - Yesterday I submitted a PR to clean up [act warnings](https://reactjs.org/docs/test-utils.html#act) in our tests
- **What are you doing today?** 
    - Continuing my quest to clean up test warning! I'm also currently reading Emma Bostian's [De-Coding the Technical Interview Process](https://technicalinterviews.dev/) so I want to spend 30 minutes reading
- **Do you have any blockers**
    - Time is definitely the biggest factor stopping me from doing a lot of tech stuff on the side. By the end of the day I really want to step away from the screen especially now that I'm fully vaccinated! To solve this I'm hoping to wake up at a consistent time and start side project stuff before getting to work. 

## Day 2 - 06/03
- **What did you do yesterday?** 
    - Worked on act warning PR to clean up test output
    - Read De-Coding the Technical Interview Process sorting algorithms sections. These are still tough for me, I think recursion is really throwing me for a loop in some of these algorithms so I plan on finding some more resources that help me visual the process and then trying to code my own version. 
    - Added a tweet article link to my digital garden posts
- **What are you doing today?** 
    - Hoping to fix more tests but cleaning them up is proving more difficult than the first time around. I plan to spend more time really understanding how the component is written and more act articles. 
    - 30 more minutes of reading
    - Set up repo and packages for bullet journal side project
- **Do you have any blockers**
    - Starting new projects is always very overwhelming for me. I think I don't know where to start and the initial setup isn't enjoyable for me so I lose steam pretty quickly when I really just want to code and see stuff pop up on the screen. 

## Day 3 - 06/04
- **What did you do yesterday?** 
    - More testing PRs
    - Finished reading De-Coding the Technical Interview Process!
- **What are you doing today?** 
    - Works tests are still full of act warnings
    - set up repo and packages for bullet journal side project
- **Do you have any blockers**
    - Starting projects are still tough for me but I'm hoping to work a little bit since it's Friday and I have a bit of extra time

## Day 4 - 06/05
- **What did you do yesterday?**
    - More testing PRs
    - Set up [bullet journal](https://github.com/jenkens-dev/bullet-journal) repo! Installed a bunch of packages
- **What are you doing today?**
    - 2 30 minute sessions for my side project
- **Do you have any blockers?**
    - I work best in the morning but on the weekend, I tend to sleep in a little later and get chores done right away so I lose my usual morning work time. The upside with splitting the work into small 30 minute sessions is they feel more approachable so I can work later in the day. 

## Day 5 - 06/06
- **What did you do yesterday?**
   - Set up Mikro-orm for my bullet journal side project and started making database tables
- **What are you doing today?**
    - 2 30 minute sessions for my side project, focusing on continuing backend progress
- **Do you have any blockers?**
    - I kind of want to manga and watch K-dramas all day 

## Day 6 - 06/07
- **What did you do yesterday?**
   - Set up part of my GraphQL schema and worked on resolvers
- **What are you doing today?**
    - Fixing some UI bugs and submitting PRs for work
    - Working on authentication for side project
- **Do you have any blockers?**
    - Just your usual case of the Mondays, feeling motivated to work on my side project but work is kind of stale
